# Stock Prediction with NLP using BERT
## Overview
Leverages tweets to interpret market sentiment and predict whether a stock will move up or down.

## How it Works
The model is built using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture, and fine-tuned with additional layers.

Several ways to prevent overfitting, including data augmentation, freezing BERT base layer, adding dropout layers.
